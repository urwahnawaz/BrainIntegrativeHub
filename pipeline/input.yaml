            This section allows detailed exploration of all datasets, including <a href=BrainSpan>BrainSpan</a>.
            Expression values (for instance, in Transcripts per Million ; TPM) can be plotted against metadata variables selected from the drop-down menu. 
            A boxplot is generated for categorical metadata variables and a scatterplot is generated for numerical variables.  In the case of numerical variables, 
            a second categorical variable can be selected to color the datapoints â€“ eg. TPM vs Age plot with data points colored by Brain Region.
            A scatterplot of circular RNA vs linear RNA expression shows the relationship between circRNA expression in CPM and the 
            parental linear RNA expression quantified based on the expression of the upstream and downstream linear junctions (SJ), normalised as CPM.
